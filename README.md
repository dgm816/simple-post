simple-post
===========

A very simple Python NNTP binary posting application intended to be contained
within one Python file.

This should allow for portability across platforms and serve as an example of
building NNTP related libraries in Python. This project is intended to be very
simple to allow for quick posting to NNTP servers from the command line.
Additional features may be added as time passes to enhance the basic
functionality of the program.
